## Introduction
Sparsebit is a toolkit with pruning and quantization capabilities. It is designed to help researchers compress and accelerate neural network models by modifying only a few codes in existing pytorch project.

## Quantization 
Quantization turns full-precision params into low-bit precision params, which can compress and accelerate the model without changing its structure. This toolkit supports two common quantization paradigms, Post-Training-Quantization and Quantization-Aware-Training, with following features:

- Benefiting from the support of torch.fx, Sparsebit operates on a QuantModel, and each operation becomes a QuantModule.
- Sparsebit can easily be extended by users to accommodate their own researches. Users can register to extend important objects such as QuantModule, Quantizer and Observer by themselves.
- Exporting [QDQ-ONNX](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/mobile/helpers/#qdq-format-model-helpers) is supported, which can be loaded and deployed by backends such as TensorRT and OnnxRuntime.

### Results
- PTQ results on ImageNet-1k: [link](https://github.com/megvii-research/Sparsebit/blob/main/examples/post_training_quantization/imagenet1k/basecase/README.md)
- PTQ results of Vision Transformer on ImageNet-1k: [link](https://github.com/megvii-research/Sparsebit/blob/main/examples/post_training_quantization/imagenet1k/deit/README.md)
- PTQ results of YOLO related works on COCO: [link](https://github.com/megvii-research/Sparsebit/blob/main/examples/post_training_quantization/coco2017/yolo_series/README.md)

## Sparse 
Sparse is often used in deep learning to refer to operations such as reducing network parameters or network computation. At present, Sparse supported by the toolbox has the following characteristics:

- Supports two types of pruning: structured/unstructured;
- Supports a variety of operation objects including: weights, activations, model-blocks, model-layers, etc.;
- Supports multiple pruning algorithms: L1-norm/L0-norm/Fisher-pruning/Hrank/Slimming...
- Users can extend a custom pruning algorithm easily by defining a Sparser
- Using ONNX as the export format for the pruned model

### Documentations
Detailed usage and development guidance is located in the document. Refer to: [docs](https://sparsebit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### CV-Master
- We maintain a public course on quantification at Bilibili, introducing the basics of quantification and our latest work. Interested users can join the course.[video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV13a411p7PC?p=1&vd_source=f746210dbb726509198fbec99dfe7367)
- Aiming at better enabling users to understand and apply the knowledge related to model compression, we designed related homework based on Sparsebit. Interested users can complete it by themselves.[quantization\_homework](https://github.com/megvii-research/Sparsebit/blob/homeworks/homeworks/quant_homework.md)
